=========================================
ERLANG installation
=========================================
Install using an administrative user https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/download/OTP-23.1.5/otp_win64_23.1.5.exe

Set ERLANG_HOME to where you actually put your Erlang installation, e.g. C:\Program Files\erl{version} (full path, we have version=23.1.5). 
The RabbitMQ batch files expect to execute %ERLANG_HOME%\bin\erl.exe.

Go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > System > Advanced > Environment Variables. 
Create the system environment variable ERLANG_HOME and set it to the full path of the directory which contains bin\erl.exe.

Restart computer

Check that Erlang is working:
open cmd and type -> “%ERLANG_HOME%\bin\erl.exe” : should see a Eshell prompt

=========================================
RabbitMQ Server installation
=========================================
Once a supported version of Erlang is installed, download the RabbitMQ installer, rabbitmq-server-{version}.exe and run it. 
It installs RabbitMQ as a Windows service and starts it using the default configuration.

Go to https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html and download & run rabbitmq-server-3.10.0.exe

Open new cmd and type:
cd C:\Program Files\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-{version}\sbin

Example -> cd C:\Program Files\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-3.8.9\sbin
Execute command -> rabbitmq-plugins.bat enable rabbitmq_management
Execute command -> rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_shovel rabbitmq_shovel_management

Edit C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts file. Add to it the following line:
127.0.0.1 rabbitmq

Once all done open : http://rabbitmq:15672/ for opening the rabbitmq management.
